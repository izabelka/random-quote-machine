# Random Quote Machine App

## For my [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/izabelka/100-days-of-code)

I've created a simple one page app in React.js that displays random quotes.

### To do:
1. [x] Import quotes from json file
2. [x] Build component that displays quote
3. [x] Add New Quote button and make it work
4. [x] Add button for Twitter sharing
5. [ ] Share the whole quote on Twitter
5. [ ] Style page
3. [ ] Publish to Github Pages / Codepen
